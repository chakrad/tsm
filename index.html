	<h1>Welcome to The Salt Miners</h1>
	<h2>Found Some Salt? We're Here to Help</h2>
	<h3>We specialize in salt mines, but anywhere salt thrives, we arrive.</h3>
	
	<p class = "gray"> The Salt Miners, or TSM for short, was started in 1865, and throughout
	our lifetime has served to obtain salt from every single corner and edge of our earth.
	</p>
	<p>In our infancy, we were reserved just to any pure sources of salt like mines and bodies
	of water. But in this new era, we've been able to expand our business to more sectors
	all across the world due to advances in techologies, the digital world, and entertainment.
